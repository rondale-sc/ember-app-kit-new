# Ember App Kit New

Lightweight module designed to make initial setup of Ember App Kit easy!

## Installation

`npm install ember-app-kit-new`

## Usage

```sh
emberkit <path-to-directory>
```

Where `path-to-directory` is the name of your new Ember App Kit project.

## What it does

These steps are taken from EAK's [Getting Started](http://iamstef.net/ember-app-kit/guides/getting-started.html) page.

* clones the [Ember App Kit repo](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit)
* clears the newly cloned repo of its `.git` dir (so that EAK's history isn't kept)
* asks to install grunt-cli globally
* runs `npm install`
